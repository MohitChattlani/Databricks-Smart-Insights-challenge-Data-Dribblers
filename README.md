# Databricks Smart Insights Challenge – Team Data Dribblers

Welcome to the official repository for Team **Data Dribblers**' submission to the [Databricks Smart Business Insights Challenge](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-apj-databricks-smart-business-insights-challenge-empowering-data-driven-decision). This challenge empowers data professionals to harness AI-driven business intelligence tools to derive actionable insights from real-world data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages aviation data for **domestic flights in India**, sourced from the official [data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/) portal. The dataset includes details on **flight schedules**, **airport services**, **public grievances**, and **FAQs**. It serves as a comprehensive information layer supporting multiple aspects of aviation operations and customer engagement.

Using this data, we developed:
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** for Flight Schedule and Grievances Analysis
- 🤖 **Genie** – a Conversational AI solution to respond to common public queries

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The Indian aviation sector lacks accessible, consolidated insights into:
- Flight distribution trends across cities and carriers
- Patterns in public grievances related to air services
- A self-service mechanism to address frequently asked customer questions

Government agencies and airline stakeholders need tools to:
- Understand historical flight patterns and optimize capacity planning
- Track and act upon common passenger grievances efficiently
- Enhance customer service through automated, accessible information delivery

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
